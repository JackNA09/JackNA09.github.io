            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jackson Ambrose, I made this game as part of a project.This game was made over the course of two months so it is very short and primitive.
                I am a big gamer and have been playing games since I was a toddler, so the chance to make a game was very exciting to me. I love storytelling and hope to become a succesful writer,
                so this game gave me an oppurtunity to grow my skills in writing by making an interesting story based off a simple concept like going to school.

             <h2>Why I made this game</h2>
             <p>
                I made this game as part of a school project, so a lot of the features you see are things that I was taught how to do using the RPG Maker software. most of the maps, items,
                 enemies, or anything else you see in the game is created by me, using the limited time I had in class. This website is also a product of what I learned in my class, and 
                 it also took a long time to create.
